C Manpages

This contains a set of manpages for C keywords, types, and useful topics,
originally extracted from the Coherent documentation[1].
Since Coherent has been released under a license similar to the 3-clause
BSD license, they are Free and Open Source (see LICENSE for the text).

The original documentation appears to cover ANSI C89, which is more
restricted than ISO C99/C11 or the GCC dialects. For example, declaring
a variable inside a for statement:
  for(int i=0; i < 5; i++)
is not permitted by C89, but only by newer dialects.
Similarly, the "long long" type was not yet available.
But despite that, you may find this to be helpful.
