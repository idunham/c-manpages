.TH "external definitions" Overview "(Language)" Overview

A
.I definition
is a declaration that reserves storage for the thing declared.
An
.I "external definition"
is a definition whose identifier is defined outside of any function.
This makes the object available throughout the file or the
program, depending upon whether it has, respectively, internal or
external linkage.
.PP
.if \nX=4 \{\
The syntax of an external definition is as follows:
.DM
.I
	translation-unit:
		external-declaration
		translation-unit external-declaration
.DE
.DM
.I
	external-declaration:
		function-definition
		declaration
.DE
.PP \}
If an identifier has external linkage and is used in an expression
(except as an operand to the
.B sizeof
operator), then an external definition must exist for that identifier
somewhere in the program.
.PP
There are two varieties of external definition:
.B "function definitions"
and
.BR "object definitions" .
See the appropriate entries for more information.
